  <p> So many people live in poverty, mostly homeless or living in houses with low maintenance;no light or clean water. There is a bad educational system and most people end up being illiterate or not having a proper education. Some of this people that went to school can’t even get a real job.</p>

<p> Some kids hawk on the street to help the family with money and it’s not even really save for the kids because they could get hit by a car. People hawk on the street to get a little money they can use to get something to feed themselves, even though there is no good profit in this</p>

  <p> One of the main effects of poverty is poor health, there is a very poor health care and so many people can’t afford good health care. For instance HIV/AIDS,malaria and yellow fever are preventable diseases that occur in Nigeria and mostly poor people die of this diseases due to the lack of financial assistance. Also access to safe water supply has become more common although not universal</p>
