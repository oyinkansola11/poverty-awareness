   <h2> AFRICA </h2>
<p> Africa is basically the poorest continent in the World.Most of the people in Africa  lives on $1.25 a day or less, this people do labor work and their jobs are not secured. 70 percent of poor people in the World  lives in Africa, up from 50 percent five years ago.  The rate of poverty and unemployment keeps increasing in Africa. So many kids die because of illness and diseases they can’t afford to treat. Gender inequality is one of the biggest problem in Africa, in some countries in Africa they think men are superior to women and that the women should just be a full house wife; cleaning the house, cooking , taking care of the kids without a job of her own. Talking about Africa has the poorest continent, it doesn’t mean there are no rich people at all. Another main problem is that there is a huge difference between the poor and the rich, rich people basically get all of the good opportunities and can afford everything. The area poor people live is very different from where rich people live, rich people get clean water and sanitation while poor people don’t.Poor governance is a very popular cause of poverty in Africa, most government are corrupt in Africa and they tend to embezzle citizens money. Poor governance is a very popular cause of poverty in Africa.

According to World Health Organization (WHO), lower respiratory infections is still the leading cause of deaths in Somalia, followed by diarrhoeal diseases, measles, malnutrition, tuberculosis, meningitis and maternal conditions. Somalia has a very poor health care and most people can’t really afford it because most of the health care in Somalia is private. </p>
